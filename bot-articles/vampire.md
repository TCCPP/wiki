# Help Vampires :vampire:

"Help Vampires" are people who will continually ask for help on a problem in the hope that someone
will do their work for them while __putting little to no effort in themselves__.<br>
We try to be helpful and a friendly community, however, **please be mindful** that folks on this
discord are volunteering their time to help others learn. It's a waste of their time to be asked to
teach you stuff you easily could have figured out yourself.

## Symptoms of a Help Vampire :bat:

- Inability to use google effectively
- Inability to read any documentation
- Inability to "try it and see"
- Inability to provide a minimal example of the problem and instead posting walls of text, screenshots, and pastebin links.
- Inability to provide relevant information, expecting helpers to have the same context they do
- Expects answers to be handed to them
- No apparent increase in comprehension after questions are answered
- Targets a previous answerer hours or days later, often on unrelated matters

## Examples :garlic:

- "Does this work?"
- "Can someone link me to XYZ?"
- "How the SKIBIDI do I implement a segmentation tree"
