# We Do Not Help with Anything Pertaining to Cheating/Hacking/Malware
We do not for three reasons:
- It violates Discord's ToS
- It's unethical
- 99.9% of people here asking for help with cheats/hacking/malware end up being very annoying due to their lack of interest in C or C++, lack of resourcefulness, and lack of technical foundation for what they want to do.
