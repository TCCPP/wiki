# Avoid W3Schools and GeeksforGeeks

We strongly recommend **against** using W3Schools and GeeksforGeeks to learn programming.

## Problems with these sites

- **Outdated information**: They frequently teach obsolete practices and old language standards
- **Incorrect code**: Examples often contain bugs, undefined behavior, or code that doesn't compile
- **Bad practices**: They teach anti-patterns and don't demonstrate proper use of the language
- **No review process**: Content is often written by inexperienced authors with no expert review
- **SEO-optimized, not quality-optimized**: These sites prioritize search rankings over accuracy

## Why this matters

If you're learning from these sites, you're likely picking up bad habits that you'll need to unlearn
later. Worse, you may not realize the code you're writing is incorrect or invokes undefined behavior
because the tutorial told you it was fine.

## Better alternatives

For C++:
- [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) - free, comprehensive, and well-maintained
- [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/) - authoritative reference documentation

For C:
- [Modern C by Jens Gustedt](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/) - free PDF available
- [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c) - also covers C
