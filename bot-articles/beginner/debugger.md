# Debugger

Have you tried stepping through your code line by line in a debugger?

If you don't know how to use a debugger or don't have one set up, we *highly* recommend taking the time to do so.<br/>
Debuggers are immensely helpful tools for figuring out where problems emerge in code and especially when you're first
learning it can help you build intuition and understanding for reasoning through code.
