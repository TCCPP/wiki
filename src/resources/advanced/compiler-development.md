# Compiler Development

## Resources for learning about compilers:

- [_Engineering a Compiler_](https://www.elsevier.com/books/engineering-a-compiler/cooper/978-0-12-815412-0) (Mostly for
  compiler back-ends and optimization)
- [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) (yes, even for compiler devs) <--- Very beginner friendly
- [LLVM's Kaleidoscope](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/)
- [_Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools_ (The dragon book)](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811) (Fairly heavily focused on parsers.)

## Resources for learning about programming language design

- [_Types and Programming Languages_](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl)
- [_Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages_](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2718/Advanced-Topics-in-Types-and-Programming-Languages)
- [_Practical Foundations for Programming Languages_](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/)

## Resources covering both topics

- [_Essentials of Programming Languages_](https://eopl3.com/)

## Resources for learning about optimizations:

- [_"What Has My Compiler Done for Me Lately"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSkpMdDe4g4)
- [_Optimizations in C++ Compilers: A practical journey_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3371595.3372264)

## Resources for learning about computer architecture:

- [_Essentials of Computer Architecture_](https://github.com/ccceye/computer-book/blob/master/Essentials%20of%20Computer%20Architecture%2C%202nd%20Edition.pdf)
