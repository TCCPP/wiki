# Compiler Development
This is a collection of resources on compiler construction, programming language design, and related topics.

## Compiler Resources
- [_Engineering a Compiler_](https://www.elsevier.com/books/engineering-a-compiler/cooper/978-0-12-815412-0) Great for compiler back-ends and optimization.
- [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) Beginner-friendly and highly practical. Recommended even for compiler devs.
- [LLVM's Kaleidoscope Tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) An intro to building a language using LLVM.
- [_Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools_](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811) (The Dragon Book) Classic, parser-heavy, and theoretical.

## Programming Language Design
- [_Types and Programming Languages_](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl)
- [_Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages_](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2718/Advanced-Topics-in-Types-and-Programming-Languages)
- [_Practical Foundations for Programming Languages_](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/)

## Covers Both Compiler & PL Design
- [_Essentials of Programming Languages_](https://eopl3.com/) Elegant presentation of both interpretation and semantics.

## Optimization Techniques
- [_What Has My Compiler Done for Me Lately?_ (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSkpMdDe4g4)
- [_Optimizations in C++ Compilers: A Practical Journey_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3371595.3372264)

## Computer Architecture
- [_Essentials of Computer Architecture (PDF)_](https://github.com/ccceye/computer-book/blob/master/Essentials%20of%20Computer%20Architecture%2C%202nd%20Edition.pdf) Useful context for low-level compiler work.
