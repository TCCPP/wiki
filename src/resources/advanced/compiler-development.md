# Compiler Development

This is a collection of resources on compiler construction, programming language design, and related topics.

## Compiler Resources

- [_Engineering a Compiler_](https://www.elsevier.com/books/engineering-a-compiler/cooper/978-0-12-815412-0) Great for
  compiler back-ends and optimization.
- [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) Beginner-friendly and highly practical. Recommended even
  for compiler devs.
- [LLVM's Kaleidoscope Tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) An intro to building a language using LLVM.
- [_Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools_](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811)
  (The Dragon Book) Classic, parser-heavy, and theoretical.
- [_Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation_](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Compiler-Design-Implementation-Muchnick/dp/1558603204)
  More implementation-focused than Dragon Book, excellent for advanced optimizations techniques and compiler
  constructions.
- [_SSA-based Compiler Design_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-80515-9) Introduces Static Single
  Assignment form and modern intermediate representations.
- [_Linkers and Loaders_](https://www.amazon.com/Linkers-Loaders-Kaufmann-Software-Engineering/dp/1558604960) An
  essential for understanding the complete toolchain beyond compilation.
- [_Modern Compiler Implementation in Java/ML/C_](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/) Good progression from
  compiler frontend to backend.
- [_Parsing Techniques_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-68954-8) Huge survey of parsing algorithms and
  techniques beyond what is covered in Dragon Book.

## Programming Language Design

- [_Types and Programming Languages_](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl)
- [_Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages_](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2718/Advanced-Topics-in-Types-and-Programming-Languages)
- [_Practical Foundations for Programming Languages_](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/)

## Covers Both Compiler & PL Design

- [_Essentials of Programming Languages_](https://eopl3.com/) Elegant presentation of both interpretation and semantics.

## Optimization Techniques

- [_What Has My Compiler Done for Me Lately?_ (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSkpMdDe4g4)
- [_Optimizations in C++ Compilers: A Practical Journey_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3371595.3372264)

## Computer Architecture

- [_Essentials of Computer Architecture (PDF)_](https://github.com/ccceye/computer-book/blob/master/Essentials%20of%20Computer%20Architecture%2C%202nd%20Edition.pdf)
  Useful context for low-level compiler work.
