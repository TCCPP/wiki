# Getting Started with C++

C++ is a high level, general purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. The language was originally
designed as an extension of the C programming language. C++ allows the programmer a high level of freedom in their
programs. This high amount of freedom gives developers a large amount of control over how the program interacts with the
computer system running the application, but it also means that it is easy to introduce undesired behavior to the
software.

## What is C++ good at?

C++ as a language is targeted towards software development where performance and high levels of control over computing
resources is required. The language shares many use cases with other languages like C, Rust, and Zig. Here are some of
the common cases where C++ is used:

- Embedded Software
- Real-Time Systems
- High Frequency Trading
- Video Games and Simulations
- Office and Productivity Software
- Artificial Intelligence

There are also applications where C++ is not the best fit, such as web frontend. Programming languages are tools; it is
important to choose a tool that is suited to the task at hand.
