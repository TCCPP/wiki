# Language Basics

Before we dive into the bulk of the tutorial, let's discuss a few of the key pieces of the language that you will use in
every C++ program you will ever write. The goal of this section is to get you to a point where you can understand simple
C++ programs. In future sections, we will build upon these concepts while introducing new concepts. It is important to
introduce common terminology early, so you can effectively communicate about C++ using widely agreed-upon definitions.

## Program Structure

In C++, your program begins execution in the `main` function, commonly referred to as the _entry point_ of the program.
Here is a simple example of a C++ program:

```cpp
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

The `return` statement tells the computer to return from the function with some result. In this case, the result `0`
indicates that the program completed successfully.

Note that statements typically end with a semicolon (`;`). If you do not use a semicolon where it is needed, you will
experience compilation errors.

::: info For Advanced Developers

Functions that do not return `void` must have an explicit `return` statement. The `main` function is unique, as the
compiler will implicitly insert a `return 0;` at the end of the function if execution can reach the end of `main`
without returning.

:::

## Comments

Programs can also contain comments, which are pieces of text within your code. These are usually used to document why
you've written code a certain way. C++ has two types of comments:

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment.

/* This is a
   multi-line comment. */
```

_Line comments_ or _single-line comments_ start with `//` and go until the end of the line.

_Block comments_ start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They don't actually have to be multiple lines long, but that's why
they're typically used instead of line comments.

## Statements

In C++, we have many different types of statements. To start, we will discuss some of the most common statements.

### Declaration Statements

Declaration statements "add stuff" to your program; doing so is called _declaring_. For example, we can declare
_variables_. Once you have declared to your compiler that something exists, you can use it later in your program with
other types of statements.

```cpp
// Declaration statement declares a variable.
int foo = 0;
```

Breaking down the statement, we will start by identifying the name of the variable `foo`. To the left of `foo`, we see
the type of the variable, `int`. Variables in C++ are required to have a type in the declaration, and a variable cannot
change type after it is declared. The equals symbol (`=`) is used to provide the variable `foo` with a value. The right
side of the `=` statement is an expression used to specify the value to assign. In this case, we are assigning `foo` the
value of `0`.

### Expression Statements

Expression statements are used to instruct the computer to perform an action.

```cpp
int foo = 0;   // declaration statement
foo = foo + 2; // expression statement
```

The above snippet creates `foo` with an initial value of `1`, then evaluates `foo + 2` before assigning the value back
to the variable `foo`.

## Identifiers

In C++, _identifiers_ give our declarations a name. In the example above, `foo` is an identifier. Identifiers can
contain alphabetic characters, `_`, digits, and certain Unicode characters, but they cannot start with a digit.

::: info For Advanced Developers

While Unicode characters can be used in C++ identifiers, the degree of support for this has changed throughout the
years. Many C++ developers prefer to use only ASCII characters in their code, which is most portable and easiest to type
on all keyboards. For example, most developers would call a variable `alpha` instead of `α`.

:::

## Keywords

C++ reserves a set of words in the language for its own use. Developers may use these keywords, but they cannot be used
as identifiers. You can find a list of all keywords on [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword).

```cpp
int my_integer_value = 0; // int is a keyword
float pi = 3.14f;         // float is a keyword

int int = 0;              // error: cannot use "int" as an identifier (variable name)
```

::: info For Advanced Developers

In addition to these "true keywords", C++ also has "contextual keywords", formally called _identifiers with special
meaning_, such as `override`. We will cover these in later chapters.

:::

## Initialization Versus Assignment

When we first create a variable in C++, it undergoes _initialization_. Initialization is the process of providing a
variable with an initial value.

```cpp
int foo = 0;
```

The above statement is one of the most common ways to initialize a variable. It gives the variable `foo` an initial
value of `0`. There are many ways to initialize a variable, each having its own pros and cons. The different types of
initialization will be discussed in more detail in another section.

Assignment is a process that takes place after a variable already exists. It is the process of assigning a new value to
an existing variable.

```cpp
int foo = 0; // initialization (begins with the type of the variable)
foo = 2;     // assignment (no type specified)
```

Like initialization, assignment has several different forms that will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter.

## Fundamental Data Types and Literals

All values in C++ have a _type_, and variables can only hold values of a specified type.

The most simple types are _fundamental types_. You have already seen variables of (fundamental) type `int` in the
examples above, and values such as `0` (also of type `int`). We will go over some commonly used fundamental types in the
following section.

### `bool`

The type `bool` can either hold the values `true` and `false`. You can use it to store the result of logic, like:

```cpp
bool b = 1 > 0; // True if one is greater than zero.
```

### Integer Types

_Integer types_ in C++ are similar to integers in math. They can store (possibly negative) whole numbers like `1` or
`-1`, but no fractions, like `0.5`.

See below a list of _signed integer types_:

| Type          | Minimum Range                                           | Minimum Width in Bits |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `signed char` | [-128, 127]                                             | 8                     |
| `short`       | [-32768, 32767]                                         | 16                    |
| `int`         | [−32768, 32767]                                         | 16                    |
| `long`        | [−2,147,483,648, 2,147,483,647]                         | 32                    |
| `long long`   | [−9,223,372,036,854,775,808, 9,223,372,036,854,775,807] | 64                    |

Additionally, there are _unsigned integer types_, which cannot store negative values.

| Type                 | Minimum Range                   | Minimum Width in Bits |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `unsigned char`      | [0, 255]                        | 8                     |
| `unsigned short`     | [0, 65535]                      | 16                    |
| `unsigned int`       | [0, 65535]                      | 16                    |
| `unsigned long`      | [0, 4,294,967,295]              | 32                    |
| `unsigned long long` | [0, 18,446,744,073,709,551,615] | 64                    |

::: info

As seen in the table, these ranges are minimums, and the exact size can vary. For example, `int` and `unsigned int` are
usually 32-bit, so they're wider than the 16-bit minimum. `long` and `unsigned long` are 64-bit On 64-bit \*nix systems,
and 32-bit on Windows.

The C++ standard library provides exact-width aliases like `std::int32_t`.

:::

### Character Types

In addition to `signed char` and `unsigned char`, C++ has a type `char`. All three of these types are used for character
representation, and are one byte large. The standard does not specify if `char` is signed or unsigned, but is is a
distinct type. On x86-64, `char` is typically signed, whereas on ARM64, it is typically unsigned.

Throughout the years, further character types were added to C++:

- `wchar_t` - A character type that is typically wider than the `char` type. It is typically 32-bit on \*nix platforms,
  and 16-bit on Windows.
- `char8_t` - A character type that can represent any UTF-8 code unit.
- `char16_t` - A character type that can represent any UTF-16 code unit.
- `char32_t` - A character type that can represent any UTF-32 code unit.

### Floating-Point Types

A floating-point type can represent

- integers (e.g. `0`),
- numbers with fractional parts (e.g. `0.5`),
- positive or negative infinity, and
- NaN (not a number).

However, since floating-point numbers are fixed-size, they can only represent certain fractional numbers exactly. For
example, `0.1` cannot be represented exactly by a floating-point number, and neither can be extremely tiny or extremely
large numbers.

There are at least three fundamental floating-point types in C++: `float`, `double`, and `long double`. The range of
representable values for a `double` is required to be at least as large as that of a `float`, and the `long double` must
have a range at least that of a `double`. The language does not provide many strong guarantees about the properties of
the various floating-point types.

::: info IEEE-754 Floating-Point Model

Because C++ needs to support many different types of computers, it does not enforce that floating-points are represented
in a specific way. For the sake of this tutorial, we will assume that you are working on a device that uses the IEEE-754
floating-point specification. This is the case for almost all consumer hardware. The rest of the tutorial will make the
assumption that a `float` is an IEEE-754 binary32 format float and that a `double` is an IEEE-754 binary64 format float.

| Type     | Range                  | Width |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| `float`  | $\pm 3.402 * 10^{38}$  | 32    |
| `double` | $\pm 1.797 * 10^{308}$ | 64    |

The type `long double` has the restriction that its range must be at least as large as a `double`. On many x86-64
platforms, it is implemented as an IEEE-754 binary64 extended format, where the width of the type is 80 bits. However,
MSVC is an exception to this rule, where it is only 64 bits. On other platforms, it may be implemented as a IEEE-754
binary128 format float.

:::

### Literals

Literals are a way that C++ allows us to provide a value directly in the code. You may recall above where the code
snippets were creating variables using numbers in the code. Those numbers are referred to as literals.

Integer literals are just numbers in code with no trailing fractional part. By adding a `u`, you can tell the compiler
that the literal represents an unsigned integer type. Floating-point literals are numbers in code with a trailing
fractional part. Without a `f` at the end, the compiler will treat the number as a `double`. By adding a trailing `f`,
the compiler now treats it as a `float.

```cpp
int foo = 3; // This is an integer literal
int ufoo = 3u; // This is an unsigned integer literal
float bar = 3.14f; // This is a floating-point literal for a float
double baz = 3.14; // This is a floating-point literal for a double
```

## Basic Operators

Operators are a type of expression that uses symbols to provide meaning. For example, `+` is an operator. As you may
have assumed, `+` is typically used to add values together. Here, we'll introduce a handful of operators that you can
use with the types you learned about above:

| Operator | Name           | Function                                  |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition       | Adds two values                           |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | Subtracts two values                      |
| `*`      | Multiplication | Multiplies two values                     |
| `/`      | Division       | Divides two values                        |
| `%`      | Remainder      | Returns the remainder of integer division |
| `=`      | Assignment     | Assigns a value to a variable             |

::: info The Assignment Operator

As we saw above, the equal sign (`=`) can be used both for initializing a variable and for assigning new values to
variables. Even though both use `=`, it is important to remember there is a difference between initialization and
assignment of variables. The distinction between the two will be explored further in a later chapter.

:::

In your exploration of the language so far, you may have noticed that there is a `^` operator. In math, you may think of
this as a power/exponentiation operator. In C++, this operator has a different meaning that will be discussed in a later
chapter on [bitwise operators](/resources/cpp/operators#bitwise-operators).

## Wrapping Up

In the above sections, we've covered the basics of a C++ program. At this point, you should know the basics of how a C++
program is structured, how to create a variable, some of the types that C++ provides you, and some of the operations
provided to you on those types. Additionally, you should be able to write a comment in your code. Let's bring this
together and write a simple program that changes Fahrenheit to Celsius.

The equation to convert the two is very simple: $C = (F - 32) / (9 / 5)$.

Because temperature is not a integer value, but a real number, we will use `double` to store our variables.

```cpp
int main() {
    double my_temperature_f = 68.0;
    double my_temperature_c = (my_temperature_f - 32.0) / (9.0 / 5.0);

    // Don't forget to return 0 at the end
    return 0;
}
```

This simple program converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius, but it doesn't print anything out. In the next chapter, we will
be discussing how to view values in our program.
