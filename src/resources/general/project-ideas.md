# Project Ideas

This page has a list of ideas for projects of varying difficulties. It is by no means exhaustive and is mainly meant to
provide inspiration. If an idea here catches your interest, we recommend trying to make something related to it and you
have the freedom to explore, problem solve, and be creative with what you make. There's no one right or wrong way to do
anything in computer science, try things and have fun!

Each of these can vary in difficulty and you have a lot of freedom over how much you try to do and how challenging you
want to make it for yourself. You also have complete freedom over design and what exactly you want to build. This page
is meant to be a source of inspiration rather than a list of projects to make.

[^raytracing]:
    For an introduction to concepts see
    [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > We never recommend following tutorials line for line, this results in not having to grapple with design decisions
    > or as much problem solving yourself. Instead, we recommend the tutorial for a high-level overview and intro to the
    > relevant mathematics.

[^dungeon]:
    This is a good challenge from a software design, game dev, and algorithmic standpoint. You have a lot of creative
    freedom with what you make but we have some suggestions to get started:

    We recommend exploring unicode box-drawing characters and make sure you use a terminal that supports UTF-8.

    ```
    Box characters reference:
    ╔═╦═╗
    ║ ║ ║
    ╠═╬═╣
    ║ ║ ║
    ╚═╩═╝

    Possible game screen:
    ╔═══════════════════════════════╦════════╗
    ║                               ║        ║
    ║                               ║        ║
    ║                               ║        ║
    ║                               ║        ║
    ║                               ║        ║
    ║                               ║        ║
    ║                               ║        ║
    ║                               ║        ║
    ║                               ║        ║
    ╠═══════════════════════════════╣        ║
    ║        player info etc        ║        ║
    ║  HP: XXX / XXX    MP: XX / XX ║        ║
    ║  Items: [][][][][][][][][]    ║        ║
