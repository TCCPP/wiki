## Your First Program

In order to ensure your development environment is set up correctly, copy the provided code and try to run the code.

For C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    puts("Hello, World!");
}
```

For C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}
```

If all goes correctly, you should have a terminal with "Hello, World!" printed in it.

::: tip

It is important to make sure all files are saved before you try to build and run your code. If not, your changes will
not be reflected in the executable you build.
